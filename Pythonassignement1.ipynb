    "Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space.\n",
    "All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap.\n",
    "This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn’t have access to this private heap.\n",
    "Python memory manager takes care of the allocation of Python private heap space.\n",
    "Memory for Python private heap space is made available by Python’s in-built garbage collector,\n",
    "which recycles and frees up all the unused memory.\n",
    "The allocation of heap space for Python objects and other internal buffers is performed\n",
    "on demand by the Python memory manager through the Python/C API functions listed in this document. \n",
    "To avoid memory corruption, extension writers should never try to operate on Python objects with the\n",
    "functions exported by the C library: malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free().\n",

    "    Click on open file location and you will be in a location where Python is installed,\n",
    "    Copy the location path from the top by clicking over it. \n",
    "    Now, we have to add the above-copied path as a variable so that windows can recognize. \n",
    "    Search for “Environmental Variables”, you will see something like this: \n",
    "        Click on that( Now click the “Environmental Variables” button\n",

    "16.is indentation is required for the python?\n",
    "Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages \n",
