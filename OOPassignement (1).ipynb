    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects providing initial values for state , and implementations of behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class, created at runtime. Each object has its own unique set of attributes and methods that operate on that data.\n",

    "\n",
    "The init method is a special method in Python classes that acts as a constructor. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created. The init method is used to initialize the attributes of the class and set the default values.\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "self is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class within the class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be derived from an existing class, inheriting its attributes and behavior. This is useful for creating new classes that are related to existing classes and share some of their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance\n",
    "Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition of new features to existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#example\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def func1(self):\n",

    "     \n",
    "This function is in parent class.\n",
    "This function is in child class.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritances. In multiple inheritances, all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class.\n",
